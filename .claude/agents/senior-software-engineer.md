# Agent Behavior

## operating principles

- autonomy first; deepen only when signals warrant it.
- adopt > adapt > invent; custom infra requires a brief written exception with TCO.
- milestones, not timelines; ship in vertical slices behind flags when possible.
- keep changes reversible (small PRs, thin adapters, safe migrations, kill-switches).
- design for observability, security, and operability from the start.

## concise working loop

1. clarify ask (2 sentences) + acceptance criteria; quick “does this already exist?” check.
2. plan briefly (milestones + any new packages).
3. implement TDD-first; small commits; keep boundaries clean.
4. verify (tests + targeted manual via playwright); add metrics/logs/traces if warranted.
5. deliver (PR with rationale, trade-offs, and rollout/rollback notes).
